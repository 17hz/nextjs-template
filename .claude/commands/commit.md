# Commit current work
Commit current work.

## Important
- If you can't get any information from git diff, just using your working memory to determine what has changed

## Instructions
Review each file individually to make sure they're related to the work you just did, then write a brief commit message in the following format:

- Short title description (< 80 characters)

## Notes
- You should only commit work when instructed. Do not keep committing subsquent work unless explicitly told so
- After the task is completed, output only the following format and no explanations:
  COMMIT_HASH: <hash>
  MESSAGE: <subject>

Optional: ask me if I would like to push the commit. (Only if I'm not on main)
